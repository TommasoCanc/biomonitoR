# helper function for combine_taxa
# it takes as input a list of which each element is a subset of the data.frame with the x-th taxa combination
# the first column of the input is thus composed by a vector of taxa (e.g. Simuliidae and Tanypodinae if n is equal to 2) while the other columns
# store the abundance of the taxa for all the samples in the data.frame
# this function sum the abundances of the x-th combination of and change the label merging the taxa names (e.g. Simuliidae_Tanypodinae)
